# ErlChat - Erlang based Chat Application with Vue.js Frontend

This project is a learning oriented project for my portfolio to combine
understanding of frontend technology, communication and distributed systems with Erlang.
Erlang is a language created originally by Ericsson AB for telecommunication purposes.
It has been since known to be used by WhatsApp and Klarna to develop robust fault-tolerant systems with high availability.

This repository contains code for frontend and backend. The Frontend is implemented using Vue.JS and allows clients
to directly talk with the erlang backend server. The backend server is implemented using Erlang and its main purpose is to work as a chat server. The backend server is responsible for routing the messages
between the clients as real time as possible.
